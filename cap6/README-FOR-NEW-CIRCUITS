In order to work with a new circuit:

- use as synopsys configuration file the .synopsys_dc.setup file you find in
  this directory
- adapt the sum-t.scr (used for the SUM circuit of the first exercise)
to your circuit, especially don't miss the set_wire_load_model directive
and the verilog and SDC file generation instruction
