- HOLD
	For the hold violation simulation, we can see that the violation happens between waveforms with offset 33 to 38 for LH and between 70 to 72 for HL
	
- SETUP
	For the setup violation simulation, the violation happens between waveforms with offset 16 to 19 for HL and between 54 to 60 for LH
