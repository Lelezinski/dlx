CAP1 LABORATORY

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS IN CHAPTER 5
- Question 1: The description code for managing carry-in and carry-out is missing. The problem is solvable by introducing code to take into account the carry-in bit and for computing the carry-out bit by looking at the MSB of a temporary sum made with operands with a bigger width.  
- Question 2: There are no differences.
- Question 3: The last two carry-outs are delayed with respect to the first one, by the amount specified inside the testbench.
