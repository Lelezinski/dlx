The bigger NAND has an higher driving capability with respect to the smaller
one by design. As a consequence, in both simulations the X8 performs better in
terms of response time, although the advantage becomes noticeable (i.e. one
order of magnitude) only with the bigger load. On the other hand, the peak
current in X8 is higher, giving an higher power consumption.
